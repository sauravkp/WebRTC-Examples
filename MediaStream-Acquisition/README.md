# Mediastream acquisition

Media stream acquisition is an important aspect of any WebRTC call. Without the camera and mic, a WebRTC call has ver less meaning if we are not using data cahnnels only for a p2p file transfer like application. In this example, you will learn how use the gtUserMedia API to acquire the camera and microphone currently available in the device.

## Steps to run the example

Open the demo.html file with either Firefox or Chrome browser as any standard html file. Once the file is loaded, it will ask you permission for sharing your camera and mic with the webpage. As soon as you allow it, you will be able o see your own video strem inside the page. Keep in mind that you need to allow the webpage to access your camera and mic. If you don't allow it, you won't be able to view your own video in the webpage.
